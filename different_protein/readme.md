[^Fig.6]: Analysis of differential [protein expression](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/protein-expression) and verification. (A) Volcano map of differentially expressed genes, with [proteomics](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/proteomics) (| log2FC | >0.1, *P* < 0.05) (left) and [RNA sequencing](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/rna-sequence) (| log2FC | >0.25, *P* < 0.05) (right). Red = upregulated. Green = downregulated. (B) Venn diagram of protein differences between the SHED group and CMS121 group. Red = SHED group. Green = CMS121 group. Orange = co-differentially expressed protein group. (C) Expression of Hook3, [MIF](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/migration-inhibition-factor), Micos13 and [Rps9](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/ribosome-protein) in Ctrl and SHED sample. (D) Heat map of [differential gene expression](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/differential-gene-expression) in each sample. Red = high expression. Green = low expression. Protein expression level in [SAMP8](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/senescence-accelerated-mouse) mice injected with SHEDs (left) and [mRNA expression level](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/mrna-expression-level) in SAMP8 mice injected with CMS121 (right). (E) Protein levels of MIF, Hook3 and Mic13 in hippocampal region, as detected by [western blot](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/western-blot) and measured by ImageJ. (F) [Quantitative analysis](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/quantitative-analysis) of western blot results. **P* < 0.05, ***P* < 0.01. Ctrl, control; FC, fold change; mRNA, messenger RNA.
